# Welcome to data-science-portfolio-IN repo!

This is a repo dedicated to demonstrate some of my data science projects conducted for various purposes. 

## Project topics

The projects focus on analyzing a variety of academic and practical topics using statistical methods and machine learning techniques. The main languages used to construct the analysis are either python or R. In selective topics, SQL and non-SQL database languages, such as Neo4j are used as well. 

## Structure of the repo

I organized this repo by project. Under each project, I strive to present a consistent collection of content, including a overall project presentation, related code for the analysis, and relevant report associated with the project. 

Note that many of these projects initially were group projects. Therefore I presented the overall results including the results from other collaborators, while only present my part of code for fairness purpose.
